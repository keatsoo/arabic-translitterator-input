# Arabic Translitterator Input
This is an input method that works like Google IME or Yamli, but in a more modern and personalized way.

## TODO:

### In the core...
- [x] Create the Arabic Model class
- [ ] Get textual corpora (right now it's only a poem bade by ChatGPT)
- [ ] Normalize corpora
- [ ] Create a method to load corpora from a file
- [ ] Get input
- [ ] Check input type
- [ ] Naively transliterate (I need to make it better)
- [ ] Stem (I created a very rudimentary stemmer, I need to make it better)
- [x] Fuzzy search in the corpora, prioritizing the words with same stem

### GUI...
- [ ] Make a way to get the text that is being typed
- [ ] Update in real time
- [ ] Offer multiple options
